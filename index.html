      <p>Welcome to my website. My name is Alexander Beck (I usually go by my last name, so you can just call me 'Beck') and I am a nurse in Alaska. I graduated from a university in northeast Portland in 2019 and have worked in various roles as a nurse since then. In the summer of 2022, I started studying computer science and software development with the goal of eventually switching to a tech focused career. I have created this website to share and elaborate on my resume, to give a better picture of who I am as an individual.</p>
      <p>Click on the 'Resume' section to see my most updated resume and download a pdf version. Click on the 'About Me' section to read about my goals and hobbies and also to see what I'm currently learning and working on. Click on the 'Computer Science' section to see the specifics on how I am learning computer science topics, including what classes I am taking and what programming languages I am using. Finally, click on the 'Nursing' section to get an idea of what my nursing experience and qualifications are.</p>
      <p>Look below to see my email and phone number if you are trying to get in touch with me. Also below is the link to my Github account where you can see examples of code that I have written.</p>
      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Before going to college, I was very interested in the outdoors. I dreamed about backpacking the Pacific Coast Trail (a hike that takes six months) and living in a van in the woods. I liked to climb, study trees, and go camping. The only thing was that I couldn't make a living off these activities. I thought I was decently smart so I figured I should go into the medical field. For some reason, that was how I thought smart people make money. The only problem with the plan was that it was based on finding a job that makes a lot of money when it should have been based off of finding a job that I enjoyed.</p>
      <p>When going to college, I decided to go the traditional route of finding a four year degree and living on campus. I went to Concordia University in Northeast Portland as an honors pre-nursing student. After two years, I got accepted into the official nursing program where the difficulty quickly ramped up. If I didn't get good grades, I would've been kicked out and I would've have had to find a new degree to work on. During that time, everything was so stressful that I considered on multiple occasions dropping out and finding a new career path. The thing that kept me going was the fear of needing to find another degree and possibly needing more years of school and more debt on top of that. I saw the passion my colleagues had and wished I had the same motivation. I was in it to get a degree and get a job as soon as I could.</p>
      <p>I started my career as a nurse in southern Oregon at a mid-sized hospital. I jumped back and forth between day and night shift and eventually found myself working in the ICU. Incidentally, at the same time was the start of the COVID pandemic. This meant that a large portion of my job was working with dying COVID patients in the ICU. Enduring this experience for three years made me feel very jaded. It was at my lowest of times that I decided that I wanted to change careers.</p>
      <p>Not knowing where to start, I began by wondering if I could make a blog or Youtube channel about one of my many hobbies. I learned HTML and CSS to do this but found that they aren't really required these days. Most websites are created through GUI applications where it isn't necessary to know how to put together any code. While my plans to become famous by making a blog or Youtube channel fell through, I found that I really enjoyed working with HTML and CSS. I enjoyed the idea of being able to make computers do things that other people couldn't make them do. When I researched true programming languages, I stumbled on Python, which has a non-intimidating syntax. I began studying Python on Codecademy.com with their exercises and actually enjoyed it even more than working with HTML and CSS. From there, I talked to a friend about whether or not it was possible to become a software developer without a university degree. When I found out that occasionally there are people who become software developers without formal training, I got encouraged to pursue this as my new career. I love logic and math and one of my favorite things about programming is starting with what seems like an impossible problem and designing a solution that looks relatively simple.</p>
      <p>Currently, I work at an outpatient cardiac cath lab as an RN. I spend 40 hours per week working there and much of the rest of my time working on the skills that I will need to one day be successful in a software developer position. While there are many distractions along the way and it takes an incredible amount of focus to stay on track, I find a lot of joy in many of the things that I have learned. I will not stop until I am successful at finding work as a software developer.</p>
