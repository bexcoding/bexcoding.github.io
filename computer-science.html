      <h1>Courses, Portfolio, Languages, and More</h1>
      <h2>OSSU Course List</h2>
      <p>GitHub is home to a repository of online computer science classes compiled by OSSU (the Open Source Society University). The goal of the linked repository is to provide a path "to a free self-taught education in Computer Science". There are all of the classes that one would expect to find in a typical cs degree from a university and many of the classes are provided by universities like MIT or Stanford. Class categories include classes in programming, math, systems, databases, information security, and ethics. There is an estimated completion of time of two years if one can manage 20 hours per week. Many of the classes are offered and hosted by EdX and Coursera.</p>
      <h2>Completed Classes</h2>
      <p>Below is a list of the classes that I have completed so far, the general topics that were covered in those courses, and the dates that I completed them. The classes were taken from an online repository of programming classes available for free on the internet. There is a link to the classes embedded in their names. If you want to find out more about the class list I'm following, see the bottom of this page.</p>

      <h2>Coding Portfolio</h2>
      <p>After a year of progress with my studies, I came to a point where I felt that I had learned a lot but didn't have anything to show for it. After doing some research and talking to others already in the field, I found out that people who don't have formal degrees in computer science often present a portfolio of their work instead. I decided that I would make a two part portfolio. One part is this website, which seeks to explain more about myself, my motivation, and my goals surrounding my career change. The second part is my GitHub account, which shows the code that I have written. On my GitHub account, there is a repository named "portfolio" that contains all of the code that I want to showcase. This collection is not all of the code I have ever written - who wants to read a list of answers to 1000 different basic function writing exercises? Instead, I only include my best work or work that showcases my growth over time.</p>
      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>This is a list of languages that I have experience with through the classes or projects that I have worked on. I know them to varying degrees. The language that I currently have the most experience with is python.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Code Editors</h2>
      <p>These are the code editors that I have used for various coding assignments in the past. I started with Brackets and VS Code because they were the most intuitive, free code editors. I tried the rest of the editors for different classes over time. I enjoyed the modality of vim but found it somewhat difficult to use. I wasn't excited to try Emacs but found it easy to move around and edit without having to worry about getting in and out of different modes. It is my current favorite, although I do miss the intuitive, sleek feel of modern editors. I like the possibility with Emacs to use the keyboard nearly all of the time instead of switching between the keyboard and mouse. If it is still my favorite editor after going through all of my CS classes, I will customize and continue to use it.</p>
