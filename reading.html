      <p>Included here are the books, articles, and textbooks that I have been reading. They vary in subject and many of them are worthwhile reads. A good deal of them are related to science and technology. I believe that reading is a source of continued intellectual and personal growth and that reading of nearly any sort can help increase our underlying understanding of the world we live in.</p>
