        <p>This page will display my updated "status" as to what I am working on currently. It will be sorted by most recent to oldest updates. Each update will be left as-is. In other words, I will not go back to earlier updates to change what my current favorite editor or language is, for example. Each update will be a snapshot in time to show my overall progress.</p>

        <h2>March 2023</h2>
        <p>I have been very busy in March working towards my goal of learning computer science. Much of this time was spent improving my portfolio repository on GitHub, reading books on CS concepts, and working on different classes. </p>
        <p>GitHub:</p>
        <p>I have more than doubled the code and content that I have on my portfolio on GitHub. This is thanks to the time that I spent on two projects - the "Cipher Project" and the "Algorithm Project". The cipher project followed along with the book "Cracking Codes With Python". I worked on several well known ciphers and made sure that they were functioning efficiently. The algorithm project was similar in that I used several different well known sorting and searching algorithms as coding practice. I tested the real-world efficiency of these algorithms with automated testing and presented the resulting data and graphs based on the data. It turned out that the algorithms were every bit as efficient as I intended them to be. As a way to describe how the code in these two projects worked, I learned how to diagram programs using Mermaid diagrams (they are an easy way to make diagrams written in markdown).</p>
        <p>Other:</p>
        <p>I read through several books this month, including a book on intermediate Python, a book on coding and cracking ciphers, and a book on data structures and algorithms. I also browsed through a couple different courses on Coursera. I didn't finish all of them because, if I do not feel that it is going to be relevant information to my particular goals, I move on to content that will help me reach my goals faster. </p>

        <h2>February 2023</h2>
        <p>This past month has seen an important addition to my computer science journey: the start of my portfolio. I have created two components to my portfolio. First, I have created this website. This website acts as host to my resume and also showcases my background in a way that a resume cannot. It talks about who I am as an individual and why I studying computer science. Second, I have started a portfolio repository on GitHub to showcase code that I write. I decided to create these portfolio components as a way of showing my work. After recently reviewing a year of progress, I realized that I felt much smarter and had a lot more skills than before, but I didn't have anything to show this in a tangible way. For many beginning software developers, the tangible proof of their knowledge is a degree received from a university. Because I don't have a degree in computer science, I will have to create my own proof of my continued progress. This February marks the start of this project and I will anticipate working on this project from now until I begin applying for software developer jobs in a year and a half.</p>
        <p> In addition to working on this portfolio, I have been working on a class called "Programming Languages, part B". It has been an informative class and I appreciate two major things that came from the class: working with Racket and working with Emacs. I actually enjoy the strict written syntax of Racket, as I find it very clear to follow the structure when evaluating the code, even though it can be a little bulky to write. I think it may be a language that I want to continue to develop along with Python. Editing code on Emacs has been very interesting and I actually enjoy the way that it interacts with the file system on the computer without having to go back and forth between editor and command line like Vim. I also like that it is less visually distracting when compared to a modern editor like VS Code.</p>
        <p>A couple other things that I have been working on in February:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changing Emacs to Doom Emacs to get an upgraded Emacs with Vim bindings.</li>
          <li>Switching away from the Windows OS for the first time and running Linux via Ubuntu.</li>
          <li>Reading a book called the Missing Readme which talks about basic things that programmers wish they knew when they joined the field.</li>
          <li>Learning basic electronic soldering. I have been practicing on a clock and a radio.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Past Year in Review (2022)</h2>
        <p>For the past year (since early 2022) while working as a nurse, I have studied the beginning concepts of programming. I have learned the basics of Python and have tried various other languages like JavaScript and Racket. I have also tried different editors including Vim, Emacs, and VS Code. Also, I started working on open source classes. Some of the biggest obstacles have been simply figuring out how to use the terminal and how files are organized in general on a computer. I have come a long way and have sampled a lot different ideas and I am working as hard as ever to progress toward my eventual goal of working in the tech field as a software developer. As I go forward with about a year and a half until I expect to start looking for work in the field (Fall 2024), I am starting to put together this website and an accompanying portfolio of code on GitHub. Other updates will come over time describing what I am currently working on.</p>
